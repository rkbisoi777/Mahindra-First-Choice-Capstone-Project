# Mahindra-First-Choice-Capstone-Project

It's capstone project from my data science journey based on Mahaindra First Choice Service Dataset.

Mahindra First Choice is a Car Service Company focusing on customers to expand their business and model enhancement which is why they need an overall analysis of customers and their behaviours.

The main goal of this project is Geolocation Analysis of Customers and Market Segmentation of Customers.

The ML Algorithm for this project is K-Means Clustering for Market Segmentation.

And, Geolocation based analysis is done by using Tableau.
